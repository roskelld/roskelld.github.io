  description: `<p>In January 2017 a meetup group was formed to bring people together in Edmonton to talk about Bitcoin. Since that time the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/yegbitcoin">Meetup.com</a> group has grown to over 700 members.</p>
                <p>The core organizers decided that to help improve the setup we would form a company structure to allow us to create a more formalized approach to the meetup, extending the number of monthly events, adding more content, and bringing in a wider range of guest speakers.</p>
                <p>We currently host a range of education, networking and technical growth events per month, covering the complete beginner-to-advanced range of experience levels.</p>`

        <p>Attached to the machine is a <a href="https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html">NODE MCU ESP8266</a> Microcontroller unit (MCU) with WiFi and an <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/1.54inch-e-paper-module.htm">e-Paper screen</a>. The MCU connects to <a href="https://acinq.co/">ACINQ Strike</a> and requests a Lightning Network Invoice, then generates a QR code for the e-Paper screen. A User can then use their own LN enabled Wallet on a phone and scan the QR code. Once a payment signal has been received a credit is issued to MAME.</p>`

  description: `<p>I made this test project whilst I was exploring the possibilities of WebVR tech. This was the second project I worked on and I wanted to test out things like collision, interaction, sound. The idea of using Wolfenstein 3D came about because I wanted something I was familiar with so I could test my results against the existing game. Plus I wanted to see what it felt like to walk around the first FPS game I ever played but in VR.</p>
                <p>This was an interesting experiment. The A-Frame library allows you to create 3D VR enabled spaces using HTML markup, which is great fun though due to it relying on the DOM to create worlds it's not performant for use for spaces which can't be held comfortably in memory at one time; I believe that Wolfenstein 3D could well work as the levels are simple and small enough.</p>

 description: `<p>After the release of the iPhone and iPod Touch I began to explore the platform and I develop a number of game ideas designed around the touch screen. The goal with most of them was to try and play to the strengths of the device rather than mimic a traditional pad control.</p>
               <p>Bubblefall is one of the ideas that I produced, and prior to developing it on the iPhone I experimented by creating a quick animatic in Flash, to help me figure out the motion and the assets I'd need for the game.</p>
               <p>I also elected to use the Gameboy color palette of green tones, partly because the screen was much nicer than the old Gameboy screen so I wanted to see how a game in that style would look, and also I wanted to make sure I was focusing on the gameplay experience and not getting sidetracked by the graphics.</p>
               <h5>Gameplay</h5>
               <p>The premise of Bubble Fall is to get a high score by collecting the coins which appear on the screen in random waves. To do this the player must place bubbles into the level in order to direct the Hero character. The game finishes if the Hero lands on the ground or gets hit by any of the hazards that spawn in the level. Hazards will also pop bubbles if they touch. The difficulty of the game increases over time as more hazards take up space on the level, making it more challenging to place bubbles and guide the Hero to the coins. Directing the Hero comes from the angle he lands on the Bubble, the positioning of the Bubble and its size. This aspect of the game requires some learning in order to be able to perfect directing the Hero to the coins and navigating the hazards.</p>`,

  description: `<p>Sparkshot is a <a href="https://blog.lightning.engineering/posts/2018/05/02/lightning-ux.html">Lightning Network</a> art platform upon which artists can upload their original artwork to the site and it is launched in a blank state. Users then purchase pixels and add personalised message using Bitcoin over the Lightning Network. This process slowly reveals the art whilst also adding a meta layer on top for each individual purchase. Observers can then view both the art as it appears as well as look at the posted messages and shapes of pixel groups.<p>
                <h5>The Lightning Network</h5>
                <p>The Lightning Network protocol allows for instant transactions to happen at near-zero fee, and in amounts as tiny as a fraction of a cent, achieving nano-scale payments across the internet with no requirement for a 3rd party payment provider like PayPal or Square.</p>
                <h5>The Goal</h5>
                <p>We understand that this is extremely new technology which requires a serious level of onboarding before it can be considered a viable business platform, however that process has to begin somewhere. So we set about building an application that could use an already popular medium such as images and adapt it into something that cannot be done with existing payment systems (sub-cent transactions aren't possible via existing payment services). It also had to be something that could grow but didn't require a large userbase in order for individuals to see the fun.</p>`,

  description: `<p>Forkdrop is a curated analysis of all known Bitcoin Forks and Altcoin Forks, on which cryptocurrency holders can research to see if they're eligible for any forked coins</p>
                <h5>Bitcoin Forks</h5>
                <p>During the last few months of 2017, we were looking at the trends that were happening in the cryptocurrency space. One thing of note was that after the Bitcoin fork which created Bitcoin Cash other groups saw the opportunity to also fork Bitcoin or one of the other cryptocurrencies in order to issue a new set of coins using different rules to govern from the original Bitcoin.<p>
                <p>We predicted that this would become a growing trend which might be both interesting to track as well as create benefit for any holder who might find themselves owning forked coins. Second-to-being interesting, with the cryptocurrency space being like the wild west, it was highly probable that scams would take place. So having a site which tracked these projects and where users could report bad activity seemed like a good idea.</p>
                <h5>Creation</h5>
                <p>The web seemed like a perfect fit for this type of dataset, easy for users to find, and browsers having great capability for showing well presented searchable data.</p>
                <p>We built the website using a number of open source frameworks, namely: <a href="https://materializecss.com">Materialize</a> for the layout and <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/">ag-grid</a> for the data table. The site pages are pre-generated from a dataset via a python codebase, which allows us to update and add to the site by updating the dataset.</p>
                <p>One of the challenging aspects of the project was to take the concept of a cryptocurrency fork and form a standardized dataset from it, then present that data in such a way to be useful for a general cryptocurrency holder. The presentation UI helped show the data off in an easy to observe way, but where possible we included help hints to fully explain each part.</p>
                <p>The final major component is the Guides section, which takes a different approach and steps through the concept as a set of instructions to help users claim their forked coins</p>
                <h5>Take Away</h5>
                <p>Forkdrop provided with a great challenge to create and an opportunity to learn a lot of about Web App development, deployment, hosting, and SEO (We successfully reached #2 in Google's index for Bitcoin Forks). The project has proved valuable to our users and has become the major source of data on fork coins. Thanks to how we created the site to allow for easy updating means we'll be happy to support it for years to come.</p>`,

  description: 'Dogs of War was my first time leading a position, which required me to balance my time between performing QA tasks for the development team and managing the QA team and organzing work loads. <br> This project gave me a great deal of experience in working along side each of the different disciplines within game development, learning more about how they worked and how they could be best supported to ensure smooth progress. <br>It was also my first time working with publishers, who I liased with to showcase the current game build, answer questions on behalf of the team and supporting their work in gathering information for the marketting side, such as creating and supplying screenshots and writing supporting documentation.'
